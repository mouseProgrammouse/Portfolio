## Design
  **Brief:** _Create a personal web portfolio for demonstration skills and projects. _
  
  **Design Inspiration:**
  For portfolio, I chose a clean and elegant design. I wanted to make the template as simple as possible to highlight  works. The main inspiration came from JavaScript syntax.
  
## Description
  
  **Mokup:**
  For the design prototype I used Figma. See full [project](https://www.figma.com/file/JnUa51UPcYaqSIDbHqv1Ka/Resume-web?node-id=0%3A1) at <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mouseProgrammouse/readme/master/icons/figma-logo.png" width="28"/>
  
  <img src="https://github.com/mouseProgrammouse/readme/blob/master/icons/react.png" width="28"/> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  
  **CSS Animation:** For more interactivity, I used CSS animation.
  
  **Responsive:** The application is usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers and looks good at different screen sizes. CSS breakpoints are used for switching between designs.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/mouseProgrammouse/readme/blob/master/icons/font-awesome.png" width="28"/> For icons on my website I used the most popular font icons Font Awesome.
  
<img src="https://github.com/mouseProgrammouse/readme/blob/master/icons/emailJS.png" width="28"/> Sending emails with EmailJS.  Because I donâ€™t want to set up a backend, I decided to use a popular service EmailJS. It lets to connect email client in browser, build a template and send it with EmailJS API.
